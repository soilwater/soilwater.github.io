Monitoring the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum Posted on 1-Nov-2020 Cropland monitoring station in a soybean field. We recently started prototyping in-situ stations to monitor soil moisture, canopy cover, and atmospheric conditions in cropland fields with the aim of better understanding sub-daily crop dynamics. Soil moisture is monitored using a cosmic-ray neutron detector, canopy cover is monitor via time-lapse imagery, and atmospheric conditions are recorded using an all-in-one weather station.","title":"Research"},{"location":"#research","text":"Our goal is to expand and accelerate the applications of multi-scale soil moisture information for improved management of irrigated and rainfed agricultural systems.","title":"Research"},{"location":"#monitoring-the-soil-plant-atmosphere-continuum","text":"Posted on 1-Nov-2020 Cropland monitoring station in a soybean field.

Below is a list of several simple web-apps that we want to share with other. All the applications were created using Javscript and run in teh browser without installing any software. If you have suggestions or comments, please let us, we are always looking to add few more features (as long as they remain simple and minimalistic). Quadrat A digital version of the popular wire frame that we use to sample abundance and cover. Instad of going to the field and randomly throwing a wire frame, now you can snap a picture of the area and then process the image in your desktop. Quadrat allows for a custom size mesh and rapid cell highlighting. The application is simple, but it accomplishes some of the main functionalities of analog quadrats. Whether you are cquantifying crop stubble or dandelions, we hope that this application will help you in your research and teaching exercises.

The course focuses on soil physical properties and processes and is oriented to advanced undergraduate and graduate students in Agronomy, Environmental Science, Geology, Horticulture, Civil Engineering, Biological Systems Engineering, Biology, and Ecology. The course covers mass-volume relationships for calculating soil water content, soil water potential, soil water retention curves, plant available water, and basic concepts in infiltration, runoff, drainage, and heat transfer. The course includes multiple in-class demonstrations of soil physical processes (i.e. capillaty rise, infiltration, sedimentation), hands-on labs with soil moisture sensors, and the use of simple interactive tools to help students gain deeper understanding of the different soil water properties and processes. This is a 3-credit course offered every Spring semester. Reproducible Research and Scientific Programming with Python This course is intended for students that have little or no programming experience and are interested in acquiring basic programming skills. The course will focus on understanding programming logic by developing codes for common tasks related to environmental science. The course will require students to bring their own laptop to each class. The class will be based on the Python programming language, but the course is aimed at teaching students the art of breakdown problems beyond any specific programming language. Through live and interactive coding sessions and puzzles students learn: basic commands, good programming habits, and reproducible research practices. import, process, and export data generate publication quality figures create and test custom code and models Check out the PyNotes course material Capstone Project Classic Papers of Science","title":"Teaching"},{"location":"teaching/#teaching","text":"","title":"Teaching"},{"location":"teaching/#environmental-soil-physics","text":"This course is taught as a journey through the hydrologic cycle and the soil energy balance.
